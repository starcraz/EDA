EDA - Course Project 1
======================

Project Instructions:
1. First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

2. For each plot you should

  a. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

  b. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

  c. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.

  d. Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

3. When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.

4. The four plots that you will need to construct are shown in the website.
